# Unit 4 - End-to-end modelling

This week we start using _sklearn_ to train and evaluate a model on a dataset.

## Ipython notebooks

* _facebook.ipynb_ contains the code used in the lecture. You can use it as inspiration to complete the lab, but don't spend too much time going into every detail as this was covered in the lecture!

## Lab Exercises
    
* Create a new notebook called _bank_classification.ipynb_.
	
* Check the bank dataset (description at the end of this Readme file)
	* ``bank-additional-full.csv``
	* [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)
	
* In the notebook you created

- [ ] Load the data from `bank-additional-full.csv`
- [ ] Data preprocessing:
    * Use LabelEncoder to convert the label into numbers.
    * Perform one-hot encoding on the categorical features using `df_dummies = pd.get_dummies(df)`
    * Column "duration" must be deleted
    * Check if there are any missing values in the dataset. If there are, drop the rows.
    * Plot a histogram of the label (i.e., column 'y') and calculate the imbalance in the dataset (i.e., divide the number of instances of the minority class by the total length of the dataframe).
- [ ] Let's model the data. It's very important that you follow these steps in this order or CodeRunner won't mark your solution as correct:
    * Using the `train_test_split` function in scikit-learn, separate your dataset into a training and a test set, with a test size of 20% and random_state=50. Make sure the train/test split is stratified using the `stratify` parameter (and check that it is!). Stratified means that the percentages of classes in each fold remains constant.
    * Report the results of 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set using a random forest classifier with 100 trees and depth=3. **Ensure you're using an appropriate metric** (print `sorted(sklearn.metrics.get_scorer_names())` to see what are the valid options and choose one for cross-validation).
    * Compare the cross-validation results of your classifier with those of a dummy classifier.
    * Use `GridSearchCV` to find a better set of parameters for your random forest.
    * Print the cross-validation metric (whichever you previously chose) that you obtain for the random forest for the best parameters found with GridSearchCV (on your training set)
    * What are the top 3 features?
    * Report the generalisation error (still using the same metric) on your test set.
    * NOTE: whenever you're asked to report the 'generalisation error', we're referring to the error on the test set!
- [ ] Now go to Unit 3 on Moodle and complete the Quiz to get your marks for the lab.


Attribute Information of the Bank Marketing dataset:

~~~
Input variables (i.e., features):
# bank client data:
1 - age (numeric)
2 - job : type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')
3 - marital : marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)
4 - education (categorical: 'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown')
5 - default: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
6 - housing: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
7 - loan: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
# related to the last contact of the current campaign:
8 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone') 
9 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')
10 - day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')
11 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.
# other attributes:
12 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')
# social and economic context attributes
16 - emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)
17 - cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric) 
18 - cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric) 
19 - euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)
20 - nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)

Output variable (desired target):
21 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')
